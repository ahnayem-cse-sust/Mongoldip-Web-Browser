# Mongoldip-Web-Browser

It was my academic project. Here i implemented opensource chromium extension to build this web browser.

The speciality of this browser is that the bowser has support for blind people.
Here the english text is converted to speach by windows sysnthesizer and for bengali language "subachan" is used here.

The broser will make speach output for every kind of operations.
